# ibm-sso examples

The example application uses uv as a virtual environment.

In addition, after the application is started, you can confirm the OpenAPI information through the following URL: [https://localhost:5000/docs](https://localhost:5000/docs)

> The SSL certificate used for testing can be generated by yourself, or you can directly use the certificate provided in the examples/ssl_local directory.

    ```bash
    # Depending on the environment, modify the prefix `preprod`
    W3ID_CLIENT_ID=
    W3ID_CLIENT_SECRET=

    ```
