# ibm-sso

When using `SSO Self-Service Provisioner` for single sign-on, `ibm-sso` can make your work easier.

> Currently only supports fastapi applications.

## Getting Started

```bash
pip install ibm-sso
```

## Usage

1. Add `ibm-sso` to `requirements.txt`

    ```bash
    ibm-sso==0.1.2
    ```

    > For versions above `0.1.0`, `code` and `state` are returned after successful authentication. You need to use the `code` and `state` to obtain token information.
    > 
    > For versions lower than `0.1.0`, the `token` is returned directly after successful authentication. Since the `token` is returned as the `query param` of the callback, there are security risks. Versions higher than `0.1.0` are recommended.

2. Install `ibm-sso` from `requirements.txt` file

    ```bash
    pipenv install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Set environment variables

    Refer to the [.env.template](./sample/.env.template) in the sample directory.

4. Import `ibm-sso` in startup file

    Refer to the [app.py](./sample/app.py) in the sample directory.

5. Protect your API

    If your API requires authentication to access, you can refer to [sample.py](./sample/api/v1/sample.py)

## Sample

There is a full sample in the `sample` directory that can be run directly. You can start from the sample to learn how to use ibm-sso.
